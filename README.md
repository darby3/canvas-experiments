# Canvas Experiments

## About

I'm experimenting with the HTML canvas element.

Generally speaking I'm probably recreating work that's been done elsewhere, better, but I find it a lot easier to internalize things I do or figure out for myself. Along the way I'm trying to remember to add instructive comments, both so I can look back at what I've done and remember why I did it, and with the thought that, maybe, someone flipping through this code might find something of some use to them.

That said: it's all just me doing stuff and comes with absolutely no warranty whatsoever.

## Methodology

It's a lot of...do a thing...then copy it and modify it. Do, modify. Do, modify. 

Sometimes I set out on a path with a defined end-goal in mind, and I'll try to show my work, as it were. So it's less do-modify and more inch-toward-something-that-may-or-may-not-work-ever.

## The Experiments

I'm trying to annotate these a bit, without worrying too much about naming things, hence the numerical naming conventions. It's sort of like a big sketchbook that way.

### Like a ray of light

[000001](./000001/) / 
[000002](./000002/) / 

### Circly things

[000003](./000003/) / 
[000004](./000004/) / 
[000005](./000005/) / 
[000006](./000006/) / 
[000007](./000007/) / 
[000008](./000008/) / 
[000009](./000009/) / 
[000010](./000010/) / 

### Griddy

[000011](./000011/) / 
[000012](./000012/) / 
[000013](./000013/) / 
[000014](./000014/) / 
[000015](./000015/) / 
[000016](./000016/) / 
[000017](./000017/) / 

### Scene control

[000018](./000018/) / 
[000019](./000019/) / 
[000020](./000020/) / 
[000021](./000021/) / 
[000022](./000022/) / 
[000023](./000023/) / 

### The iterations get a bit weird

[000024](./000024/) / 
[000025](./000025/) / 
[000026](./000026/) / 
[000027](./000027/) / 

### Jumping back to 000014 real quick

[000028](./000028/) / 

### Which turns into the abstraction of grid-making into its own constructor function

[000029](./000029/) / 
[000030](./000030/) / 
[000031](./000031/) / 
[000032](./000032/) / 
[000033](./000033/) / 

### And then I add offset functionality, which gets weird, but eventually is okay, more or less

[000034](./000034/) / 
[000035](./000035/) / 
[000036](./000036/) / 
[000037](./000037/) / 
[000038](./000038/) / 

### Clearly time for some light refactoring?

[000039](./000039/) / 
[000040](./000040/) /
