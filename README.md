# Canvas Experiments

## About

I'm experimenting with the HTML canvas element.

Generally speaking I'm probably recreating work that's been done elsewhere, better, but I find it a lot easier to internalize things I do or figure out for myself. Along the way I'm trying to remember to add instructive comments, both so I can look back at what I've done and remember why I did it, and with the thought that, maybe, someone flipping through this code might find something of some use to them.

That said: it's all just me doing stuff and comes with absolutely no warranty whatsoever.

## Methodology

It's a lot of...do a thing...then copy it and modify it. Do, modify. Do, modify.

Sometimes I set out on a path with a defined end-goal in mind, and I'll try to show my work, as it were. So it's less do-modify and more inch-toward-something-that-may-or-may-not-work-ever.

## The Experiments

I'm trying to annotate these a bit, without worrying too much about naming things, hence the numerical naming conventions. It's sort of like a big sketchbook that way.

### The first big round

#### Like a ray of light

[000001](./sketches/001/000001/) / 
[000002](./sketches/001/000002/) / 

#### Circly things

[000003](./sketches/001/000003/) / 
[000004](./sketches/001/000004/) / 
[000005](./sketches/001/000005/) / 
[000006](./sketches/001/000006/) / 
[000007](./sketches/001/000007/) / 
[000008](./sketches/001/000008/) / 
[000009](./sketches/001/000009/) / 
[000010](./sketches/001/000010/) / 

#### Griddy

[000011](./sketches/001/000011/) / 
[000012](./sketches/001/000012/) / 
[000013](./sketches/001/000013/) / 
[000014](./sketches/001/000014/) / 
[000015](./sketches/001/000015/) / 
[000016](./sketches/001/000016/) / 
[000017](./sketches/001/000017/) / 

#### Scene control

[000018](./sketches/001/000018/) / 
[000019](./sketches/001/000019/) / 
[000020](./sketches/001/000020/) / 
[000021](./sketches/001/000021/) / 
[000022](./sketches/001/000022/) / 
[000023](./sketches/001/000023/) / 

#### The iterations get a bit weird

[000024](./sketches/001/000024/) / 
[000025](./sketches/001/000025/) / 
[000026](./sketches/001/000026/) / 
[000027](./sketches/001/000027/) / 

#### Jumping back to 000014 real quick

[000028](./sketches/001/000028/) / 

#### Which turns into the abstraction of grid-making into its own constructor function

[000029](./sketches/001/000029/) / 
[000030](./sketches/001/000030/) / 
[000031](./sketches/001/000031/) / 
[000032](./sketches/001/000032/) / 
[000033](./sketches/001/000033/) / 

#### And then I add offset functionality, which gets weird, but eventually is okay, more or less

[000034](./sketches/001/000034/) / 
[000035](./sketches/001/000035/) / 
[000036](./sketches/001/000036/) / 
[000037](./sketches/001/000037/) / 
[000038](./sketches/001/000038/) / 

#### Clearly time for some light refactoring?

[000039](./sketches/001/000039/) / 
[000040](./sketches/001/000040/) / 
[000041](./sketches/001/000041/) / 
[000042](./sketches/001/000042/) / 

#### Which lead me back to making non-screen-filling grids

[000043](./sketches/001/000043/) / 
[000044](./sketches/001/000044/) / 
[000045](./sketches/001/000045/) / 
[000046](./sketches/001/000046/) / 
[000047](./sketches/001/000047/) / 
[000048](./sketches/001/000048/) / 

#### That we can move around?

[000049](./sketches/001/000049/) / 
[000050](./sketches/001/000050/) / 
[000051](./sketches/001/000051/) / 
[000052](./sketches/001/000052/) / 
[000053](./sketches/001/000053/) / 

#### Oh hey there's more canvas API stuff I'm not really playing with

[000054](./sketches/001/000054/) / 
[000055](./sketches/001/000055/) / 

### Bringing in three.js

#### Getting set up, viewing the lay of the land

[000056](./sketches/002/000056/) / 
[000057](./sketches/002/000057/) / 
[000058](./sketches/002/000058/) / 
[000059](./sketches/002/000059/) /
